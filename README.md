### :information_source: Information for the Delphi programmer
* You know those times when you are debugging code and you don't know where the focus is going to, and it is essential to know? This simple program, which can be incorporated into your source code, allows you to know which component the focus is on, in addition to the history, kept with numbered lines. I hope it is useful to you as it was to me.
